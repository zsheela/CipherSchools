        MERN stack is nothing but a javascript stack ehich is used 
    for easier and faster deployment of full stack web applications.
    It comprises of 4 technologies namely MongoDb, Exprexx, React and 
    Node.js. It is designed to make the development process smoother 
    and easier.
        Each of these four powerful technologies provide an end to end
    framework for the developers to work and each technologoes, play a
    big part in the development of web appliations.

    MongoDB:
        It is a cross platform Document oriented DataBase.
        MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document(The 
        storage of data follows like("firstName":"Sheela","lastName":"Boorla") 
        but not like a table format) comprising of key-value pairs that are 
        similar to JSON(Javascript Object Notation) objects. MongoDb is flexible
        and allows its users to create schema, databases, tables, etc. Documents
        that are identifiable by primary key makeup the basic unit of MongoDb. 
        Once MongoDB is installed, users can make use of Mongo shell as well. 
        Mongo shell provides a JavaScript interface through which the users can 
        interact and carry out operations(eg. querying, updating records, deleting 
        records).
        
        Why use MongoDB?
            -> Fast - Being a document-oriented database, easy to index documents. Therefore
        a faster response.
            -> Scalability - Large data can be handled by dividing it into several machines.
            -> Use of JavaScript - MongoDb uses JavaScript which is the biggest advantage.
            -> Schema Less - Any type of data in a seperate document.
            -> Simple Environment Setup - It is really simple to set up MongoDB
            -> Flexiable Document Model - MongoDB supports document-model(tables, schemas, 
        columns &SQL) which is faster and easier.
        -> Data is stored in the form of BSON(similar to JSON):
            -> Objects, Object Members, Arrays, Values and Strings.
            -> JSON syntax is very easy to use.
            -> JSON has a wide range of browser compatibility.
            -> Sharing Data: Data of any size and type(video, audio) can be shared easily.


    Express:
        Express is a backend Framework. Its ia framework inside Node.js. Rather than 
        writing the code using Node.js and creating loads of modules, Express makes 
        it simpler and easier to write the back-end code. Express helps in designing 
        great web applications and APIs. Express supports many middlewares which makes 
        the code shorter and easier to write.
        
        Why use Express?
            -> Asynchronous and Single-threaded.
            -> Efficient, fast and scalable.
            -> Has the biggest community for Node.js
            -> Express promotes code reusability eith its built-in router.
            -> Robust API.


    React:
        React is a frontend framework. It is a JavaScript library(Developed and currently maintained by Meta) that is used for 
        building user interfaces. React is used for the development of single-page 
        applications(SPA) and mobile appliations because of its ability to handle rapidly 
        changing data. React allows users to code in JavaScript and create UI components.
        
        Why use React?
        -> Virtual DOM - A virtual Dom object is a representation of a DOM object. Virtual DOM 
        is actually a copy of the original DOM. Any modification in the web application causes 
        the entire UI to re-render the virtual-DOM. Then the difference b/w the original DOM 
        and the virtual DOM is compared and the changes are made accordingly to original DOM.
        -> JSX - Stands for JavaScript XML. It is an HTML/XML JavaScript Extension which is 
        used in React. Makes it easier and simpler to write React compinents.
        -> Components - ReactJS supports Components. Components are the building blocks of 
        UI wherein each component has a logic and contributes to the overall UI. These components
        also promote code reusability and make the overall web application easier to understand.
        -> High Performance - Features like, Virtual DOM, JSX and Components make it much faster 
        than the rest of the frameworks out there.
        -> Developing Android/iOS Apps - Which React NAtive, you can easily code android-based or 
        iOS based apps, with just the knowledge of JavaScript and React.

    
    Node.js:
        It is a JavaScript runtime Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server
        (outside the browser). Node package manager i.e. npm allows the user to choose from thousands 
        of free packages(node modules) to download.
        
        Why use Node.js?
        -> Open-source JavaScript runtime Environment.
        -> Single threaded - Follows a single-threaded model.
        -> Data Streaming.
        -> Fast - Built on Google Chrome's JavaScriptengine, Node.js has a fast code execution.
        -> Highly Scalable.
