    MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React,Node

    MongoDB, is a DataBase 
    Express, is the Libraray in the javascript
    React, is for frontend
    Node is environmrnt

    User <-> Frontend Server <-> Backend Server <-> DataBase
                React               Node +           MongoDB
                                   Express
    If user sends any request in an frontend application, then the
    server asks backend for verification, the backend server sends a request to 
    DataBase to check and the respose goes in opposite way.
    For example, if we are trying to login in any page. We enter our userId and Password,
    that goes to backend and backend Server sends to DataBase to check whether the user
    name and password is present or not. Its gives the response back to the backend server 
    and it goes with frontend. Then we can see a popup as login Successful or login failed 
    accordingly.
