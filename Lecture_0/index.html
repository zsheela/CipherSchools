        MERN stand for
        M-MongoDB
        E-Express.Js
        R-React.Js
        N-Node.Js
        JSON-like documents. Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, designed for building robust APIs. React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, 
especially single-page applications. Node.js is a server-side platform built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Together, 
they provide a seamless development experience, allowing developers to use JavaScript throughout the entire stack. 
This technology stack is ideal for developing scalable, high-performance web applications. 
The MERN stack's modularity and open-source nature contribute to its popularity and extensive community support. 
It also facilitates rapid development and deployment, making it a preferred choice for startups and large enterprises alike.
